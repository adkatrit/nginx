  AUTO-GENERATED FILE

  Generated by: generate-tracks.py
  Source folder: music

  Naming tip:
  - If your files are named "Artist - Title.mp3" the script will split artist/title automatically.
  - If your files are under "./music/<artist>/..." and the filename is "Title.ext",
    the script will set artist from the folder name.
  - If an image is in the same folder as the audio file, it will be used as coverUrl.
