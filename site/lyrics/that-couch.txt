[Verse 1]
I bought a couch
The guy I bought it from said that it was his dad's
From the '70s
The back has a hole where a cat dug through the seams
It sits in my house

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm sittin' on it now
And I wonder what went down

[Chorus]
On that couch
Oh
I wanna know about that couch
How many times did he make out
On that couch
I wonder how it would play out
On that couch
I know my dad would be so proud
Of that couch

[Verse 2]
It's from the '70s
I should've brought a blacklight to the store with me
How many kids were conceived?
How many stories that I won't get to see?

[Pre-Chorus]
But I'm sittin' on it now
And I wonder what went down

[Chorus]
On that couch
Oh
I wanna know about that couch
How many times did he make out
On that couch
I wonder how it would play out
On that couch
I know my dad would be so proud
Of that couch
[Bridge]
Do you think that it still holds
The spirits of all the ghosts?
The ones that have come and gone
The ones that will linger on?
I know
