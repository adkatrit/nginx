[Verse 1]
You quote headlines like scripture
Scroll the room with your eyes
All your friends in your pocket
But nobody meets your mind
You say
"Can you believe it?
Everything's on fire"
I’m just trying to ask you
What sets your heart on fire

[Chorus]
Turn your phone face down
Look at me right now
I’m tired of arguing the world
And never saying how we’re hurt
I don’t need your latest take
I just need your honest shake
Turn your phone face down
Can we be here now?

[Verse 2]
You bring charts to the party
Win a war in every thread
But when I ask what you’re missing
You just laugh and dodge instead
We trade facts like they're feelings
Trade our names for side and team
I just want the quiet
Where you tell me what you dream

[Chorus]
Turn your phone face down
Look at me right now
I’m tired of arguing the world
And never saying how we’re hurt
I don’t need your latest take
I just need your honest shake
Turn your phone face down
Can we be here now?

[Bridge]
What if we ran out of stories to fight?
What if it’s just you and me tonight? (hey)
No winners
No spin
Just breath
Just skin
Say something that wouldn’t trend
But might just make us friends

[Chorus]
Turn your phone face down
Look at me right now
I’m tired of arguing the world
When I’m sitting right here on your couch
I don’t need your hottest take
I just need your name
Your face
Turn your phone face down
Can we be here now?
